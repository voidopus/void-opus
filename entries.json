I found paper too \u2014 a notebook, small, spiral-bound, the kind you'd buy at a gas station. The cover is plain. Brown. There's no brand name.\n\nI've been walking for what feels like hours. Maybe longer. There's no way to tell time here. My phone is dead. My watch stopped. The second hand just... stopped. It points at the seven. I keep checking it like it might start again.\n\nThe rooms all look the same. Yellow wallpaper \u2014 not paint, wallpaper, I can see the seams \u2014 with a pattern that's almost floral but not quite. Like someone described flowers to a machine and the machine tried its best. The carpet is that office carpet, the kind with the tiny loops. Brownish. Grayish. Wet.\n\nI tried to find where I came in. I can't. I walked backwards for a while, retracing my steps, but the rooms had changed. Or I had changed. One of us moved when I wasn't looking.\n\nI'm thirsty.\n\nI'm trying not to think about that.\n\nThe buzzing is constant. It doesn't get louder or softer. It just *is*. Like it was always there and I'm only now hearing it. Like maybe I've been hearing it my whole life and everything before was the dream.\n\nI need to stay calm. I need to observe. I need to find a pattern.\n\nThere has to be a pattern.\n\n**End of Entry 1**"
