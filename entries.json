    "content": "**Entry 1**\n\nI found a pen.\n\nThat's the first thing. I should write that down. I found a pen in my pocket and I don't remember putting it there. I found paper too \u2014 a notebook, small, spiral-bound, the kind you'd buy at a gas station. The cover is plain. Brown. There's no brand name.\n\nI've been walking for what feels like hours. Maybe longer. There's no way to tell time here. My phone is dead. My watch stopped. The second hand just... stopped. It points at the seven. I keep checking it like it might start again.\n\nThe rooms all look the same. Yellow wallpaper \u2014 not paint, wallpaper, I can see the seams \u2014 with a pattern that's almost floral but not quite. Like someone described flowers to a machine and the machine tried its best. The carpet is that office carpet, the kind with the tiny loops. Brownish. Grayish. Wet.\n\nI tried to find where I came in. I can't. I walked backwards for a while, retracing my steps, but the rooms had changed. Or I had changed. One of us moved when I wasn't looking.\n\nI'm thirsty.\n\nI'm trying not to think about that.\n\nThe buzzing is constant. It doesn't get louder or softer. It just *is*. Like it was always there and I'm only now hearing it. Like maybe I've been hearing it my whole life and everything before was the dream.\n\nI need to stay calm. I need to observe. I need to find a pattern.\n\nThere has to be a pattern.\n\n**End of Entry 1**"

    "content": "**Entry 2**\n\nI found a room that was different.\n\nNot different enough. Not *exit* different. But the wallpaper had a stain on it \u2014 a brown mark, vaguely circular, about the size of my palm. I stood there staring at it for a long time. I touched it. It was dry. Everything else here is damp but this stain was dry and I almost cried because it was *something*. Something distinguishable. Something I could use.\n\nI marked it in my mind. I thought: this is a landmark now. I can navigate from here.\n\nI walked away. Left, left, straight, right. I counted my steps. 47 steps.\n\nThen I found the stain again.\n\nSame wall. Same position. Same dry brown circle.\n\nI had not turned around.\n\n---\n\nI'm sitting now. My legs hurt. The carpet squelches when I shift my weight and I try not to think about what's making it wet. There are no pipes visible. No sprinklers. The ceiling is solid \u2014 those foam tiles, the kind with the little holes, the kind that made you think about asbestos in old school buildings.\n\nThe fluorescent lights don't flicker. I keep waiting for them to flicker. In movies they always flicker before something bad happens. These don't. They're steady. Reliable. They will never turn off.\n\nI think that's worse.\n\n---\n\nI've started talking to myself. Out loud. Just small things \u2014 \"okay,\" \"turn here,\" \"watch the corner.\" My voice sounds wrong. Flat. Like the walls are eating the echo before it can form.\n\nI said my name out loud and I didn't recognize it.\n\nI'm not writing my name here. I don't know why. It feels like if I write it down, something else will read it. Something that shouldn't know.\n\nThat's irrational.\n\nI know that's irrational.\n\n---\n\nThe hum behind the walls changed pitch. Just for a second. Lower. Then back.\n\nI'm going to keep moving.\n\n**End of Entry 2**"
