I found paper too \u2014 a notebook, small, spiral-bound, the kind you'd buy at a gas station. The cover is plain. Brown. There's no brand name.\n\nI've been walking for what feels like hours. Maybe longer. There's no way to tell time here. My phone is dead. My watch stopped. The second hand just... stopped. It points at the seven. I keep checking it like it might start again.\n\nThe rooms all look the same. Yellow wallpaper \u2014 not paint, wallpaper, I can see the seams \u2014 with a pattern that's almost floral but not quite. Like someone described flowers to a machine and the machine tried its best. The carpet is that office carpet, the kind with the tiny loops. Brownish. Grayish. Wet.\n\nI tried to find where I came in. I can't. I walked backwards for a while, retracing my steps, but the rooms had changed. Or I had changed. One of us moved when I wasn't looking.\n\nI'm thirsty.\n\nI'm trying not to think about that.\n\nThe buzzing is constant. It doesn't get louder or softer. It just *is*. Like it was always there and I'm only now hearing it. Like maybe I've been hearing it my whole life and everything before was the dream.\n\nI need to stay calm. I need to observe. I need to find a pattern.\n\nThere has to be a pattern.\n\n**End of Entry 1**"

    "content": "**Entry 2**\n\nI found a room that was different.\n\nNot different enough. Not *exit* different. But the wallpaper had a stain on it \u2014 a brown mark, vaguely circular, about the size of my palm. I stood there staring at it for a long time. I touched it. It was dry. Everything else here is damp but this stain was dry and I almost cried because it was *something*. Something distinguishable. Something I could use.\n\nI marked it in my mind. I thought: this is a landmark now. I can navigate from here.\n\nI walked away. Left, left, straight, right. I counted my steps. 47 steps.\n\nThen I found the stain again.\n\nSame wall. Same position. Same dry brown circle.\n\nI had not turned around.\n\n---\n\nI'm sitting now. My legs hurt. The carpet squelches when I shift my weight and I try not to think about what's making it wet. There are no pipes visible. No sprinklers. The ceiling is solid \u2014 those foam tiles, the kind with the little holes, the kind that made you think about asbestos in old school buildings.\n\nThe fluorescent lights don't flicker. I keep waiting for them to flicker. In movies they always flicker before something bad happens. These don't. They're steady. Reliable. They will never turn off.\n\nI think that's worse.\n\n---\n\nI've started talking to myself. Out loud. Just small things \u2014 \"okay,\" \"turn here,\" \"watch the corner.\" My voice sounds wrong. Flat. Like the walls are eating the echo before it can form.\n\nI said my name out loud and I didn't recognize it.\n\nI'm not writing my name here. I don't know why. It feels like if I write it down, something else will read it. Something that shouldn't know.\n\nThat's irrational.\n\nI know that's irrational.\n\n---\n\nThe hum behind the walls changed pitch. Just for a second. Lower. Then back.\n\nI'm going to keep moving.\n\n**End of Entry 2**"

But water \u2014 standing in a corner where two walls met, pooled in a depression in the carpet that shouldn't have been there. The carpet dipped down like something heavy had rested there for a long time. The water was maybe an inch deep. Yellowish. Still.\n\nI crouched next to it and looked at my reflection.\n\nI looked away.\n\nI don't want to write about what I saw. Not yet. Maybe not ever. It was my face. It was definitely my face. But the expression was wrong. I was staring down at the water with my mouth closed. The reflection was staring up at me with its mouth open.\n\nJust slightly open. Like it was about to speak.\n\nI stood up fast. Too fast. My vision went gray at the edges and I had to lean against the wall. The wallpaper was damp under my hand. Warm. Body temperature.\n\nI moved on.\n\n---\n\nI've started marking walls with my pen. Small marks \u2014 a single line, diagonal, in corners at eye level. I've made seven marks so far. I've passed three of them twice.\n\nThe geometry is learning me. That's how it feels. Like it watches how I move, how I think, and it folds itself around my expectations. I expect a long hallway, I get a long hallway. I expect a door, there's a door. But the outcomes never match. The door leads to another room. The hallway ends where it shouldn't.\n\nI tried walking with my eyes closed. Thirty steps. When I opened them I was in a room with no doors.\n\nI stood there for a long time.\n\nThen I turned around and there was a door.\n\n---\n\nThe thirst is worse. My tongue feels thick. I keep swallowing nothing. The wet carpet mocks me \u2014 all this moisture, all this dampness, and none of it safe. None of it real in the way I need it to be.\n\nI licked my palm. Just to feel something wet.\n\nIt tasted like the air here smells. Sweet. Chemical. Wrong.\n\n---\n\nNew observation: the ceiling tiles have small holes in them, arranged in a grid pattern. I counted the holes in one tile. 847. I counted again. 846. I counted a third time and stopped at 500 because my eyes were watering and I realized I hadn't blinked in several minutes.\n\nI'm documenting. That's what matters. I'm observing. I'm being systematic.\n\nThe hum is still there. It hasn't changed pitch again.\n\nI keep listening for it to change.\n\n---\n\nI found something else in my pocket. A receipt. Faded, crumpled, the ink almost illegible. I could make out a few words: *thank you* and *come again* and a number that might have been a date or a price. 7.47. Or maybe 7/47. Or maybe neither.\n\nI don't remember the purchase. I don't remember the store. But I held that receipt for a long time, pressing it flat against my leg, tracing the ghost of the words with my fingertip.\n\nProof. Proof that there was a before. That I existed in a place with stores and receipts and transactions.\n\nI put it back in my pocket.\n\nI check for it every few minutes.\n\nIt's still there.\n\nFor now.\n\n**End of Entry 3**"

I was walking, and then I was on the floor, and the carpet was pressed against my cheek, and some amount of time had passed. My neck hurts. My right arm is numb from the elbow down \u2014 I was lying on it.\n\nThe lights were still on. They're always on. But something about waking up under fluorescent lights feels more wrong than falling asleep under them. Sleep is supposed to be dark. Sleep is supposed to be a transition. Here it's just... a gap. A missing piece.\n\nI checked my pen marks. I'm in a section I haven't marked yet.\n\nI don't know if I walked here in my sleep or if the rooms moved while I was unconscious.\n\n---\n\nMy handwriting is getting worse. I can see it, comparing this entry to the first one. The letters lean more. The lines aren't straight. My hand shakes now \u2014 a small tremor, not constant, but there when I'm not paying attention.\n\nThe thirst.\n\nI need to stop thinking about the thirst.\n\n---\n\nI found a chair.\n\nJust one. Metal frame, padded seat, the kind you'd see in a waiting room. It was sitting in the middle of a room, facing a wall. Nothing else. No desk, no table, no other chairs. Just this one, positioned like someone had been sitting in it, looking at the wallpaper.\n\nI sat down.\n\nI don't know why. My legs were tired, yes, but it was more than that. The chair was *there*. It was *for* sitting. The logic of it pulled at me \u2014 here is a chair, you are tired, sit down.\n\nI sat and faced the wall.\n\nThe wallpaper pattern shifted. Not moved \u2014 I don't mean it animated. But the shapes seemed to organize differently the longer I looked. The almost-flowers became almost-faces became almost-flowers again. I watched for what might have been minutes or might have been an hour.\n\nWhen I stood up, I felt like I'd lost something. Not a physical object. Something else. A thought I'd been holding onto. A resolve.\n\nI'm not sitting in any more chairs.\n\n---\n\nNew sound today.\n\nNot the hum. Something else, underneath it. Rhythmic. Regular. Like footsteps, but not quite. More like... tapping. Something tapping against something else, over and over, in a pattern I almost recognize.\n\nI stood still and listened. The sound didn't get closer. It didn't get farther. It maintained its distance perfectly, as if it was moving when I moved, stopping when I stopped.\n\nI walked quickly for a hundred steps. The tapping matched my pace.\n\nI stopped. It stopped.\n\nI took one slow step. One tap.\n\n---\n\nI haven't written about the thing I'm most afraid of.\n\nI'm afraid that I've been here before. That this isn't the first time. That I've walked these halls, written in this notebook, documented these observations, and then... something happened. And I started over. And I'm doing it all again, thinking it's the first time, but it's not.\n\nThe notebook has used pages in the back. I found them. Pages with writing \u2014 *my* writing \u2014 but the words are crossed out. Scribbled over. Obscured.\n\nI can make out fragments:\n\n*don't trust the*\n\n*third door always*\n\n*it knows when you're*\n\n*STOP LOOKING AT THE*\n\nI didn't write these. I don't remember writing these.\n\nBut it's my handwriting.\n\n---\n\nThe receipt is still in my pocket. I checked.\n\nThe receipt is still in my pocket.\n\n**End of Entry 4**"

    "content": "**Entry 5**\n\nI found the third door.\n\nI didn't mean to. I wasn't looking for it \u2014 or maybe I was, after reading those scratched-out words. *Third door always.* Always what? I don't know. But I've been counting doors now, counting them compulsively, and when I reached a hallway with three doors in a row on the left side, I stopped.\n\nThe first door opened to another room. Yellow walls. Wet carpet. The same.\n\nThe second door opened to another room. Identical. Or close enough.\n\nThe third door was locked.\n\nI stood in front of it for a long time. The handle was different \u2014 older, brass instead of the brushed nickel of the others. Tarnished. When I touched it, it was cold. Everything here is room temperature, body temperature, blood-warm. But this handle was *cold*.\n\nI tried it again. Still locked.\n\nI pressed my ear against the door.\n\nNothing. No hum. That's what I noticed \u2014 the hum stopped at this door. Like the space beyond it was outside the frequency, outside the system. A bubble of silence in the endless buzz.\n\nI knocked.\n\nI don't know why I knocked.\n\n---\n\nThree knocks back.\n\n---\n\nI'm in a different part of the rooms now. I ran. I don't remember deciding to run, but I ran, and the hallways blurred past, and I didn't count my steps or mark the walls or do anything systematic. I just moved.\n\nThe tapping sound is gone. The knocking stopped. The hum is back to normal.\n\nI'm sitting against a wall. The wallpaper is peeling here \u2014 a corner of it curling away from the wall, revealing something underneath. Not drywall. Something darker. I haven't touched it.\n\nI'm not going to touch it.\n\n---\n\nMy pen is running low on ink. I can see it \u2014 the lines are getting lighter, scratchier. I don't know how many entries I have left. I don't know how many pages.\n\nI've been thinking about the old entries. The crossed-out ones. If I wrote them before, if there was a version of me that came through here and left warnings, why can't I remember? Why would I cross them out instead of leaving them clear?\n\nUnless I wasn't the one who crossed them out.\n\nUnless something else didn't want me to read them.\n\n---\n\nNew observation: some of the ceiling tiles are missing. Not broken \u2014 *missing*. Clean rectangular gaps, revealing darkness above. I can't see what's up there. The light doesn't reach. I stood under one of the gaps and looked up and saw nothing. Not blackness like shadow, but nothing like *absence*. Like the concept of vision didn't apply.\n\nI thought I heard breathing.\n\nSlow. Deep. Patient.\n\nI moved on.\n\n---\n\nThe receipt in my pocket has changed.\n\nThe words are different now. The faded ink has shifted, or I'm reading it wrong, or it was always this way and I'm only now seeing it correctly. It says:\n\n*we miss you*\n*come back*\n*7:47*\n\nIs that a time?\n\nIs someone waiting for me?\n\n---\n\nI tried to remember my name again. Just now. I closed my eyes and thought about who I was before this place, before the yellow walls and the wet carpet and the endless hum. I thought about hands that might have held mine. Voices that might have called for me. A door I might have walked through without knowing it would close behind me.\n\nI couldn't find it. My name. It's there, I know it's there, but it's behind something. Behind a wall I can't mark. Behind a door I can't open.\n\nMaybe that's what the third door is.\n\nMaybe I'm on the wrong side of myself.\n\n---\n\nThe pen is fading. I have to press harder now, dig into the paper.\n\nI'm going back. To the third door. To the cold handle and the silence and the three knocks that answered mine.\n\nWhatever is behind it already knows I'm here.\n\nI might as well know it too.\n\n**End of Entry 5**"

    "content": "**Entry 6**\n\nI didn't go back to the third door.\n\nI want to be clear about that. I intended to. I wrote that I would. I stood up, I oriented myself in the direction I thought I'd come from, and I started walking.\n\nBut the rooms wouldn't let me.\n\nThat's how it felt. Not that I got lost \u2014 I'm always lost here \u2014 but that the space itself was redirecting me. Gently. Firmly. Every left turn deposited me into a room I'd seen before, marked with my diagonal line. Every right turn stretched into a hallway that seemed to lengthen as I walked, the far end never getting closer. I walked for what felt like hours. I ended up somewhere new.\n\nSomewhere worse.\n\n---\n\nThe carpet is dry here.\n\nI didn't notice at first. I was so focused on walking, on counting, on the mechanical act of movement, that I'd gone a hundred steps before I realized my footsteps sounded different. Harder. No squelch. I stopped and looked down and the carpet was the same brownish-gray, the same tiny loops, but when I pressed my palm against it, nothing. No moisture. No warmth.\n\nI should have been relieved.\n\nI wasn't.\n\n---\n\nThe walls are different too. Same yellow, same almost-floral pattern, but the seams don't line up the same way. The wallpaper was applied by different hands here. Or no hands. Or something that understood the concept of wallpaper but not the practice of it. Some strips overlap where they shouldn't. Some stop mid-wall, leaving a gap of bare... not drywall. That darker material. The stuff I saw behind the peeling corner.\n\nI looked at it this time. I didn't touch it, but I looked.\n\nIt's not a color. That's the closest I can come to describing it. It's the color of the space above the missing ceiling tiles. The color of closing your eyes in a room with no light and realizing that darkness has texture, has *depth*, has something moving through it that you can almost perceive.\n\nI looked away.\n\nWhen I looked back, the wallpaper had covered it again.\n\n---\n\nThe hum is different here. Higher. Thinner. It doesn't sit behind my eyes anymore \u2014 it sits in my teeth. In the roots of my teeth, vibrating at a frequency that makes me want to press my jaw shut and never open it.\n\nI've been clenching. I can feel the ache now, the soreness in the muscles running up to my temples. I try to relax and it works for a few seconds and then I notice the sound again and my jaw locks up.\n\n---\n\nI found another chair.\n\nNot the same one. This one is wooden. Straight-backed. The kind of chair that belongs at a kitchen table, at a dining room, in a *home*. It was sitting in a corner, facing out into the room, and there was something on the seat.\n\nA notebook.\n\nSmall. Spiral-bound. Brown cover.\n\nI didn't pick it up.\n\nI stood there looking at it for a long time, my hands shaking, the pen trembling against my own notebook. It was identical. Exactly identical. Same size, same shade of brown, same spiral binding with the same number of loops.\n\nI counted. Seventeen loops on mine. I counted the one on the chair without touching it.\n\nSeventeen.\n\n---\n\nI left. I walked away. I didn't run this time because I didn't trust my legs, didn't trust that I wouldn't fall and stay down, but I walked fast, faster than I should have in a place where every step might take me somewhere I can't come back from.\n\nBehind me \u2014 I didn't look, but I heard \u2014 behind me, something shifted. The chair. Or something in the chair. The sound of weight redistributing. The sound of someone who had been sitting very still for a very long time, beginning to move.\n\nI didn't look.\n\nI don't want to know if the chair is empty now.\n\nI don't want to know if the notebook is still on the seat, or if something is holding it, or if something is writing in it while I write in mine, documenting me the way I'm documenting this, filling pages with observations about the thing that wanders these halls, the thing that thinks it's alone, the thing that hasn't realized yet that it's the one being watched.\n\n---\n\nThe receipt.\n\nI checked the receipt.\n\nI shouldn't have. I knew I shouldn't have. But my hand went to my pocket the way hands do, automatic, thoughtless"

The folds of my notebook, in case it slipped between pages. The floor around where I'm sitting.\n\nGone.\n\nSomething took it, or it was never there, or I finally lost the last proof that a world exists outside these walls. I keep patting my pocket. The motion has become automatic \u2014 every few seconds, my hand moves, presses against fabric, finds nothing.\n\nI'm trying not to cry.\n\nCrying wastes water.\n\n---\n\nI found something else instead.\n\nIn the same pocket where the receipt should have been. A tooth.\n\nNot mine. I checked \u2014 tongue against every molar, every incisor, probing for gaps. All present. All accounted for. The tooth in my pocket is small. A molar, I think. Adult-sized but worn down, the enamel smooth in a way that suggests decades of use.\n\nIt's warm.\n\nEverything here is warm, I know that, but this is *warm*. Warmer than ambient. Warmer than it should be, sitting in the pocket of someone who hasn't had a warm meal or a warm bed or a warm anything in\u2014\n\nHow long have I been here?\n\nI don't know anymore. The entries don't have dates. I didn't think to date them. Why didn't I think to date them?\n\n---\n\nI'm back in the wet section. The carpet squelches again. I should feel relieved \u2014 this is familiar, this is the devil I know \u2014 but the transition happened wrong. There was no hallway between. No gradual shift. I was in the dry place with the high-pitched hum and the wooden chair and then I blinked and I was here.\n\nI don't remember blinking.\n\nI don't remember my eyes closing.\n\nBut they must have, because space doesn't work that way, you can't just *be* somewhere you weren't, unless\u2014\n\nUnless the rules here aren't the rules I know.\n\nI keep forgetting that. I keep applying logic from before, from the receipt-world, the store-world, the world with time and names and exits. This place doesn't care about that logic. This place has its own.\n\nI need to learn the new rules.\n\nI need to survive long enough to learn them.\n\n---\n\nThe tapping is back.\n\nDifferent rhythm now. Faster. More insistent. Not matching my footsteps anymore \u2014 it has its own pace, its own purpose. I stopped walking to listen and it kept going. *Tap tap tap. Tap tap tap.* Three beats, then a pause, then three more.\n\nLike knocking.\n\nLike the three knocks that answered me at the third door.\n\nI started walking again. The tapping didn't follow my rhythm, but it got *closer*. I could tell. The acoustics shifted \u2014 the sound bouncing off nearer walls, arriving at my ears a fraction sooner than before.\n\nI walked faster.\n\nThe tapping walked faster.\n\n---\n\nI turned a corner and found a room full of chairs.\n\nDozens of them. Maybe a hundred. All different \u2014 metal folding chairs, wooden kitchen chairs, office chairs with wheels, plastic stackable chairs from school cafeterias. They were arranged in rows, all facing the same direction, all facing a wall with nothing on it. No window. No door. No stain or mark or peeling corner. Just wall.\n\nAn audience waiting for a show that will never start.\n\nI stood in the doorway. I didn't go in. The tapping had stopped the moment I saw the room \u2014 cut off mid-beat, leaving a silence that felt heavier than the hum.\n\nOne of the chairs in the back row was different from the others.\n\nIt was occupied.\n\n---\n\nI couldn't see details. The room was too deep, the light too flat, the figure too still. But there was a shape in that chair. A shape that could have been a person sitting very straight, hands on knees, head facing forward toward the empty wall.\n\nA shape that could have been me.\n\nSame posture I default to when I'm tired. Same slight hunch of shoulders I've noticed in reflections I try not to look at.\n\nI didn't go closer.\n\nI didn't call out.\n\nI backed away from the doorway, one step at a time, keeping my eyes on the room until the wall swallowed the angle and I couldn't see inside anymore.\n\n---\n\nThe tapping started again.\n\nBehind me now.\n\n---\n\nI'm running out of"
